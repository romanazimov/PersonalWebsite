# Personal Website

## Project Concept
The concept driving this project stems from my desire for a personal website. Through code, I aim to exhibit my present and past projects, using it as a medium of self-expression. My enthusiasm for adopting cutting-edge technology and playing around with it adds to my excitement about having a dedicated platform to continually refine and develop.
